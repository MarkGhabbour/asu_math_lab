Testing of the project using Dr.Mohamed examples


1) Advanced example
      a) A ->wrong answer A =33.5 not 12  (martin)
      b) B-> right
      c) C-> right, only comment the part showing "my favourite part" (martin)
      d) X & Y both gave run time errors (mark , martin)
      e) G-> printed in a wrong way	(farag)
      F) D,E,F, L -> right answers	
      
2) Errors example
      a) A=[1 2; 3] -> it was treated the same as A=[1 2;3 0] also it is a wrong input (fady farag)
      b) B= 5/0 -> answer was 1.#inf, right answer should be Inf (martin)
      c) C = 3 * (2 + 4 + -> right answer

3) Example.m
      a) we should handle the case of defining more than one matrix in a line separated by a comma (farag)
      b) D= A-B -> gave wrong answer (mark, martin)
      c) E -> right
      d) H=C' -> wrong answer, it gave a zero result (farag, martin)
      e)  G -> right answer but printintg martix numbers is not alligned, also the precision is not the same for all numbers in                   printing and handle negative signs (farag)
      f) F=A/B -> right answer but there is a mistake in alligning of numbers in printing (farag) 

4) Tricky example
      a) A-> wrong answer, it gave a zero result instead of 3608.9 (martin)
      b) rest is right
 
5) big Example
   NOT TESTED YET

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Testing of multiplication of matrix by itself ==> a^100

a) a=[1 2;-0.5 -4]; a^100
    --> run time error, right answer=  
      1.0e+57 *
     -0.3444   -3.3006
